  "Returns a vector of random numbers generated by the
   ANU Random Numbers Server.

   You have 3 choices for option ':type':
   :int8  an integer between 0-255   (default)
   :int16 an integer between 0-65535
   :hex16 a hexadecimal string between 00-ff

   The ':blocks' option is relevant only for type :hex16. It sets the
   hexadecimal block size and must be a number between 1-1024. The default
   is 1.

   The ':length' option is the number of random numbers to be returned.
   The default is 1.

   If option ':https' is true, the connection will be established using
   the https protocol. Note, however, that presently the ANU server has
   an untrusted SSL cert. The default is false (http is used).

   If the requested vector is larger than the server's maximum (1024),
   repeated requests need to be made. A connection pool is used in the
   hope of increasing throughput. Unfortunately, actual experience
   shows no improvement. Perhaps the ANU server disallows persistent
   connections -- or something else is going on."
